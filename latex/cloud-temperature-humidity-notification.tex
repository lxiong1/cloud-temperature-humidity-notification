\section{Context}
The Cloud Temperature \& Humidity Notification System is about an IoT system that gives the ability to notify user(s) of temperature and humidity fluctuations within their home through the usage of a Simple Message Service, which is also known as SMS. Though this is the main concern of the system, it also allows users to visualize their daily climate averages in an interactive graph. The graph is automatically updated for the users to view whenever they want to. Behind the scenes, all computation and background processes are done behind the user by using cloud technology.\\

Working within the limitations of a small apartment, money, and of time alloted for the project, I am unable to realize the full potential of the system. This project represents a single IoT device that enacts the above mentioned functionalities. One can imagine however, being able to send in-home area location data and climate readings with a multiple of these IoT devices scattered across a home with multiple rooms and stories. A user would be notified where in the house and when the climate has reached unwanted levels, and then be able to see data points for each specified area of the home. That is aspiration. However, this particular projects seeks an minimum viable product.

\section{Problem \& Market Research}
The Cloud Temperature \& Humidity Notification System seeks to solve the issue of the middle ground for home automation.
